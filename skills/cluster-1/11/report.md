## Summary
This code will count up every second until it reaches 100 then it'll cycle back to 0.
Also attached is the i2c alphanumerical display which will display the time on the timer.
The timer will also reset to 0 when the button is pushed.

****I DONT KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE ALPHANUMERICAL DISPLAY BUT IT DOESNT DISPLAY THE NUMBER CORRECTLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE LIGHTS WONT TURN ON****
