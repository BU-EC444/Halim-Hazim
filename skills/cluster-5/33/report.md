## Summary
This skill explores the uses of PID calculations in order to make proportional changes.
We have to determine a center line that we want to maintain and using the PID calculations as well as the error introduced, we can calculate the amount of change needed to be closer to the center line.

Keeping in mind that the center line will not be achieved instantenously so the reading can overshoot or undershoot multiple times but it will do that less and less until the center line is achieved.

In this skill, we're using a LIDAR to calculate the distance and find the error. We will light up different LEDs depending on the value of the error.
