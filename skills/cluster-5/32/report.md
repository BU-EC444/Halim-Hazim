## Summary
The wheel speed skill is about fnding the current velocity of the crawler by using an encoder.
The encoder is placed near a wheel template that consists of alternating white and black print on it. 
The concept is that the transitions is measure and once enough transitions is made for a whole rotation, we can use the information gathered to calculate the current velocity.

The information gathered are: 
    1) Time for one rotation
    2) Distance traveled (calculating circumference since we know the radius of wheel = 3.5cm)

The formula used is Distance/Time which would give us velocity in terms of cm/s
