## Summary
This skill uses the i2c accelerometer to calculate the roll and pitch of the device.
The i2c uses a communication between the master device and slave device which will rad and write bytes with each other. A 16 bits binary is sent to the ESP and will be converted to engineering units.

Result images are posted in various position of the sensor
