## Summary
This skill uses a Raspberry Pi to be an  access point of a domestic wifi connection.
At the end of the skill, I am able to connect to the wifi connection routed from the raspberry pi named "Group05"

However, using internet sharing via USB cable actually caused some issues on my end. I wasn't able to SSH into the RPi so I configured a wpa_supplicant.config so th RPi can connect to the wifi directly and I'm able to SSH into it without issue
